Input Dataset
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
Version 1.0

6 activities of 30 human subjects were captured through the use of Gyroscopes and Accelerometers embedded in a smartphone. 6 activies were:
1. Walking
2. Walking upstairs
3. Walking downstairs
4. Sitting
5. Standing
6. Laying

2 types of signals are available in the extracted data
Time Domain
Frequency Domain

Output File

The output file contains of 81 columns with the first 2 being "Subject" and "Activity"
The remaining 79 columns consists of values that shows the average of each variable for each subject
The data has been ordered subject-wise.

The remaining 79 columns are named as follows. The names have been cleaned up to ensure better readability
